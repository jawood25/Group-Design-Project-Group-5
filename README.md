Repository for Group 5 in the CSU44098 Group Design Project module.

## Step by Step

### How to run the app

Follow these steps to run the app. You'll need to split your terminal into **two**:

` one for the frontend and another for the backend. `

#### Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to the Backend Directory**
   ```bash
   cd ./backend
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Start the backend server by running:
   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```
   - The server-side is listening at port `3001`.

#### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the Frontend Directory**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies using npm:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the frontend by running:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
- If you see the message from Flask on `http://localhost:3000`, it means everything is working correctly!

### How to test the app

#### Backend Testing

#### Running Backend Tests

1. **Navigate to the Test Directory**
   - Open a terminal window and navigate to the backend tests directory:
     ```bash
     cd ./backend/tests
     ```

2. **Execute the Tests**
   - Run the following command to execute the tests. This will trigger the backend tests and display a summary in the terminal:
     ```bash
     python run_pytest.py
     ```
     
3. **View Test Coverage and Report**
   - Coverage report.
     - Open `./backend/tests/htmlcov/index.html` to view the coverage report.
   - Summary report.
     - Open `./backend/tests/report.html` to view the summary report.
