## How to run the app
Split your terminal. One for frontend and another for backend.

In the backend directory, run source /bin/activate. You can use pip install to install packages.

Run python app.py. This is a server-side, which is listening at 3001.

In the frontend directory, run npm install.

Then, Run npm start

If you see the message from flask on http://localhost:3000, it's working!
