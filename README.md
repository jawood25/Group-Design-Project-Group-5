## How to run the app
Split your terminal. One for frontend and another for backend.

(For Mac) In the backend directory, run **pip install -r requirements.txt**. You can use pip install to install packages.

(For Windows) In the bin directory, run **pip install -r requirements.txt**. You can use pip install to install packages.

Run **python run.py**. This is a server-side, which is listening at 3001.

In the frontend directory, run **npm install**.

Then, Run **npm start**

If you see the message from flask on http://localhost:3000, it's working!
